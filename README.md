# AMChallenge


Coding challeng for a company.

The ideia here was to create 2 APIs, on public and another private.

Public API:
 - Should authenticate using JWT tokens
 - Be the access point to the Private API
 
Private API:
 - Should authinticate using an API key
 - Connect to the "algorithm" that returns the similiraty percentage of 2 words

More info can be found on the PDF attached, there is also a complementing Postman collection
